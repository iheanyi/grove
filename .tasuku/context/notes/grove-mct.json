Consistent worktree directory structure (e.g., ~/.grove/worktrees/\u003cproject\u003e/\u003cbranch\u003e)\n2. Better project grouping in menubar UI using main_repo\n3. Centralized worktree storage option\n4. Ensure all servers have corresponding worktree entries with main_repo populated\n\n## Background\nCurrently worktrees are scattered across the filesystem. The menubar groups them by parent directory which isn't always meaningful. This epic tracks improvements to make worktree management more intuitive.",
